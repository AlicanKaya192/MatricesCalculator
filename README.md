# MatricesCalculator

This project is a console application for performing various matrix operations. Users can input two matrices and perform operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Additionally, users have the option to transpose the matrices before performing the operations. This calculator is written in C# and provides an interactive experience for matrix manipulation.

## Features:

- **Matrix Input**: Users can input two matrices of any size (as long as the rules of matrix operations are met).

- **Operations**:
  - **Sum**: Adds two matrices of the same size.
  - **Subtraction**: Subtracts one matrix from another of the same size.
  - **Multiplication**: Multiplies two matrices (if the number of columns of the first matrix equals the number of rows of the second matrix).

- **Transpose Option**: Users can choose to transpose either of the matrices before performing any operations.

- **Clear Output**: Results for the operations are displayed in a readable matrix format.

### Instructions:

1. **Enter Matrix Dimensions**: The program will first prompt you to enter the number of rows and columns for two matrices.

2. **Input Matrix Elements**: After entering the dimensions, you will be asked to enter the elements for each matrix.

3. **Transpose Option**: After the matrix elements are input, the program will ask if you would like to transpose each matrix.

4. **Choose an Operation**: After entering the matrices, the user can choose from the following operations:
  - **Sum**: Adds the two matrices (if their dimensions match).
  - **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second matrix from the first one (if the dimensions match).
  - **Multiplication**: Multiplies the two matrices (if the number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of rows in the second matrix).

5. **Clear and Reset**: The user can clear the current matrices and input new ones.

6. **Exit**: The user can exit the program at any time.
